                  <h3>My story</h3>
                  <p>I fell in love with Python thanks to this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery/">ZTM course</a> 
                  by Andrei Neagoie. The idea to start learning programming came to me during the last month of my most recent job. I was trying to pick a time when I was enjoying my work the most and realized that it was when 
                  I was learning to work with a program we used in one of my previous job experiences to automate data 
                  upload into our database. It was the learning 
                  on the go, the gradual improvement, figuring out how to do things better and more efficiently that made 
                  this experience stand out.</p>

                    <h3>Plans and the purpose of this website</h3>
                    <p>As of now, this website contains a selection of my favourite projects that I wrote during the course. 
                    Besides the course, I have also been working on turning what used to be a project of running a web 
                    server into my personnal website and I plan to add new projects as I gain more experience.</p>
                    <p>My previous jobs were in finance, one in accounting and two in financial markets – working as a data analyst in a
                    data vendor company collecting investment funds data and working as a risk manager in an investment company.
                    These experieces had their challenges regarding working with computers but IT was never the core of it.
                    I really enjoy programming in Python and so I’m looking  for my first job experience as a Python programmer. 
                    If you have an offer for me or even in case you just want to say hello, feel free to do so on the Contact page 
                    (Yes, the contact form really works).</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, in case you run into any difficulties while browsing my website, please let me know what steps you took
                    on tomas.klecl@seznam.cz so that I can replicate the issue and fix it. It is still a work in progress. Thanks!
